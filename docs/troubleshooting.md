## Wrong map detection
Wrong map detection can happen when:
- Moving quickly between different maps
- Other UIs overlapping
- The map is not expanded fully

Rule of thumb is:  Map detection will always try to crop the white border and make it is as tight as possbile. So before
creating a new map, double-check to see if the map being displayed has white border cropped and looks similar to the
one in the game.

Fix methods:
- Below the map are three buttons, two of which can be used to help troubleshooting:
    - `Re-detect map`: Use this button to re-detect the map
    - `Delete map`: Use this to **permanently delete** the map
- Move the map UI around
- When moving around different maps, it may detect previous map due to delay. Just use `Re-detect map` 
button for this case.

## Actions contention (?)
Action with `EveryMillis` can lead to contention if you do not space them out properly. For example, if there are two `EveryMillis` actions executed every 2 seconds, wait 1 second afterwards and one normal action, it is likely the normal action will never
get the chance to run to completion.

That said, it is quite rare.

## Default Ratio game resolution
Currently, the bot does not support `Default Ratio` game resolution because most detection resources are
in `Ideal Ratio` (1920x1080 with `Ideal Ratio` or 1376x768 below). `Default Ratio` currently only takes effect
when play in `1920x1080` or above, making the UI blurry.

## Preventing double jump(s)
**This is subject to change** but if you want to the bot to only walk between points then the two
points `x` distance should be less than `25`.

## Up jump key
- If you are a mage class:
  - If you have up jump, which most mage classes now have, you don't need to set this key
  - If you use teleport as up jump, set this key to same key as `Teleport key` 
- If you are Demon Slayer, set this key to up arrow
- If you are any other class with up jump skill such as Explorer Warriors, Blaster,... set this key to that skill

## Missing installation
If you use the bot on a newly installed Windows, make sure [Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022) and [WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2?form=MA13LH) are installed.

## Unstucking state
Unstucking state is a state that helps the bot from being stuck by UI dialog, undetectable player position, rope, etc..
However, this state can also transition due to wrong setup. This state can be caused by the following main reason:
- The bot successfully detects the minimap but failed to detect the player and thinks the player might be inside the edges
- The bot tries to perform action that requires movement but the player did not move after a while
- When using remote control app:
  - Usually the Num Lock key can cause the bot to send `4826` instead of arrow keys in the `Default Input Method` and bot will keep moving in one direction caused by pressing `Jump key` without arrow keys
  - Using the bot with through remote control requires precise game window size on the host (the PC that runs the bot), check the remote control documentation for more details
